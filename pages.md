	+ Internet_10 (just to get the hang of Qt Framework).
 - 3D design using SolidWorks:
	+ Delta Robot (Graduation project).
	+ 3D prototyping at some subjects that I have taken.
 - Arduino Programming:

	+ RC Car line follower for pick and transport.
	+ RC Car remote controlled (incomplete).
 - PCB Design (Autodesk Eagle):
	+ Workbench power supply.
	+ L298N based DC motor driver.
 - Flutter (all personal projects):
	+ Internet usage calculator (Internet_9).
	+ New Notes App (EQM Notes).
	+ Old Notes App (Notepad Markdown).
	+ Timer Application (All Jobs Timer).
	+ Remote control for RC Car (incomplete).
	

## 1. Delta Robot Control Panel Desktop App
The application was developed to help with the control of the delta robot 
from any desktop PC/Laptop to facilitate the development and control of the
project.

### why did we choose Qt
we chose Qt framework because it has a very good-looking UI and links the 
UI Elements with the backbone code that runs the application from handling 
the serial communication to doing the image processing of detecting objects
(using OpenCV) available to be picked up.

## 2. RC Car Pick & Place
This is a line follower RC Car that picks up objects from one place and 
transport them to the next place using an arm bolted on top of the car

## 3. New Notes App (EQM Notes)
This is a notes application build with flutter targeted for android devices
it can take notes as text and for each note you can add a list of checkbox items
in the checkboxes screen and it also can schedule a notification at a future time.
